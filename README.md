# [JSL09] Submission: Personal Dashboard Chrome Extension


### Objectives:

The goal of this project was to fetch various data from different APIs to create a dynamic webpage displaying a random image, cryptocurrency information, current time, and weather data based on user's geolocation.

### Reflections:
Reflecting on this project, I found it to be both challenging and rewarding. I had to apply my JavaScript fundamental knowledge, such as handling asynchronous operations and manipulating the DOM, to overcome various technical challenges. This included dynamically fetching and displaying data from different APIs, ensuring error handling for failed requests, and updating the webpage in real-time. Additionally, I had to implement logic for updating the current time every second and fetching weather data based on the user's geolocation. Collaborating with classmates provided valuable insights and allowed me to learn from their knowledge, leading to the discovery of new coding techniques and problem-solving approaches. Overall, this project significantly contributed to my understanding of APIs, asynchronous JavaScript, and DOM manipulation, making it a rewarding learning experience.


### Challenge faced:
- My weather icon did not want to load at first, it only showed a broken image picture, I realized that it was caused by syntax errors. 

- The time that was displayed also did not follow the css rules which was also caused by syntax errors.

- Understanding error handling and applying the concept was also a challenge for me.

### Areas for Improvement:

Pay more attention to detail to ensure that I don't necessarily have syntax issues.
Read more and practice error handling.


### Overall learning experience

This project provided valuable insights into working with APIs, asynchronous JavaScript, and DOM manipulation. It helped in understanding the importance of error handling, data fetching, and real-time updates in web development. Overall, it was a challenging yet rewarding learning experience.
